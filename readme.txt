== Description ==

**Enjoy hassle-free menu creation and management for restaurants, spas, salons, and more!**

The Locu for restaurant menus and merchant price lists plugin allows you to insert your restaurant menus or price lists anywhere in your site with the simple short code [menu]

Locu.com takes PDFs, Word documents, or online URLs and turns them into beautiful, structured menus that can be easily edited and styled to your liking. Once you have created your perfect Menu, you can use this plugin to insert your menu anywhere in your Wordpress site using the simple short code [menu]


**How does it work?**

**Step 1: Retrieve your menu on Locu.com**
If your restaurant menu or price list is already online, chances are we already have it on our site. You can go to Locu.com to verify your menu is available. If your menu is not already available on Locu, you can create menus on Locu.com by uploading PDFs or word documents or entering items manually. 

**Step2: Edit/Style your menu.**
You can use Locu.com to edit and style beautiful menus that match the look and feel of your Restaurant Menus site. 

**Step 3: Get javascript code on Locu to publish to your Restaurant Menus site.**
Once you are ready to publish your menu to your site, click on the "Publish" link on top of the page and follow the simple steps to generate a javascript code snippet.    

**Step 4: Use the plugin to generate the [menu] short code**
Paste the code snippet generated in step 3 in the text area of the plugin and click the "Save" button. 

**Step 5: Use the [menu] Shortcode.**
You can then use the [menu] shortcode to insert your awesome menu anywhere in your Wordpress site.

If a restaurant or other merchant already has its menu available online, chances are that it can be found on Locu.
