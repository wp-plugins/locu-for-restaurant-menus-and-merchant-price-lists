== Description ==

**Enjoy hassle-free menu creation and management for restaurants, spas, salons, and more!**

The Locu for restaurant menus and merchant price lists plugin allows you to insert your restaurant menus or price lists anywhere in your site with the simple short code [menu].

Locu.com takes PDFs, Word documents, or online URLs and turns them into beautiful, structured menus that can be easily edited and distributed across the web. Once you have created your perfect menu or price list on Locu, you can use this plugin to insert it anywhere in your WordPress site using the simple short code [menu]. 

When you update your menu or price list on Locu, your information will automatically be published on your WordPress site and on Locu’s distribution partner sites, like OpenTable, Foursquare, and Citysearch. If you’re a Locu Premium account holder, your information can also be published to TripAdvisor, Yelp, and to your Facebook page.

**How does it work?**

**Step 1: Create an account at Locu.com and verify your venue**
Create a free account at Locu.com and verify that you are the owner of your business. We want to ensure that only owners and their staff have rights to post content to their business’ page. 

**Step 2: Retrieve your menu or price list**
If your menu or price list is already online, chances are that it already exists in the Locu database. You’ll simply need to retrieve it and make edits (if required) before publishing it. If your menu or price list is not already available on Locu, you can simply upload an existing file of your menu (PDF, Word, etc) and we will automatically convert it to an online version within 24 hours. 

**Step 3: Edit your menu or price list**
Once your menu or price list has been claimed or created in Locu, use our easy-to-use menu editor to make any required changes. When you’ve finalized everything, click on the “Save Changes” button in the top-right corner of the page.    

**Step 4: Retrieve the HTML snippet on Locu to publish on your WordPress site**
Navigate to the “Publish” tab in the left-sidebar of your Locu dashboard and click on the “Install On My Website” button in the “My Sites” section of the page. Copy the HTML snippet that displays in the lightbox window. 

**Step 5: Use the plugin to generate the [menu] shortcode**
Paste the HTML snippet generated in step 4 in the text area of the plugin and click the "Save" button.

**Step 6: Use the [menu] shortcode**
You’re now ready to use the [menu] shortcode to insert your awesome menu or price list anywhere in your WordPress site!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Have a specific question or having trouble?**
 Drop us a line at support@Locu.com


**My restaurant or other business has not yet opened, or I want to try out creating a Menu without having a business in mind. How do I sign up?**

Go to Locu.com ([www.locu.com](http://www.locu.com/)) to create a free account and use a fictitious name for a business to test out Locu.

**Where do I get the Locu HTML snippet for this plugin?**

Once you have created your Locu account, retrieved your menu for your business and edited as you see fit, click on the Publish tab on the left-hand side of your dashboard. Then, click the “Install on My Website” button to get the HTML snippet. Simply paste that code snippet into the plugin's text area.

**Does Locu already have a copy of my restaurant's menu or merchant price list?**

If a restaurant or other merchant already has its menu or price list available online, chances are that it can be found on Locu. To retrieve the menu, simply create an account and enter in your venue’s name. If your menu or price list is not yet available on Locu, you can upload your menu as a PDF or Word document or manually enter items and Locu will create a structured menu or price list for you.

**How does Locu’s publish feature work beyond my WordPress site?**
If you manage your restaurant menu or merchant price list using Locu, we will also publish your information to Locu’s partner distribution sites, like OpenTable, Foursquare, Citysearch (for Basic account holders) and Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Facebook (for Premium account holders).
